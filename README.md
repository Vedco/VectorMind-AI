🚀 VectorMind-AI

Agentic RAG architecture powered by LangChain and Pinecone for scalable semantic document search and AI-driven reasoning.
Intelligent Enterprise RAG System

📌 Overview
VectorMind-AI is a modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to deliver intelligent, context-aware document querying using Large Language Models and vector similarity search.
It combines semantic embeddings, Pinecone vector storage, and agent-based reasoning to provide accurate, source-grounded responses from custom knowledge bases.
This project reflects modern AI engineering principles used in enterprise knowledge intelligence systems.
